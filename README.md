## Project Overview

This project focuses on uncovering latent thematic structures within the 20 Newsgroups dataset using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. Our objective extends to exploring the effects of incorporating additional latent structures or shared parameters into the LDA model, through variations like Structural Topic Model (STM), Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA), and Correlated Topic Model (CTM).
